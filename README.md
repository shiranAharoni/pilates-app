🚧 **Project Status: Work in Progress**
This project is under active development. I am updating it daily as I continue to build out the full Pilates experience.

Current roadmap:

Implementing a "Start Session" mode for guided workouts.

Adding user authentication to allow instructors to save custom plans.

Refining the UI for even better mobile responsiveness.

🧘‍♀️ **Pilates Repertoire App**
A full-stack web application designed for Pilates instructors and enthusiasts to manage, categorize, and build personalized exercise repertoires.

🚀 **Overview**
As a Pilates instructor, I recognized the need for a dynamic tool to organize a vast library of exercises. This project provides a sleek, professional interface to manage exercise flows, helping instructors plan sessions more effectively and providing students with clear, visual instructions.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
Frontend: React.js with React Router for navigation and Axios for API communication.

Backend: Node.js & Express.js.

Database: PostgreSQL for robust relational data management.

Design: Custom CSS3 with a focus on a "Wellness Boutique" aesthetic, featuring the Assistant Google Font for high readability.

✨ **Key Features**
Dynamic Categorization: Exercises are automatically filtered by body positions (Supine, Side Lying, etc.).

Smart Accordion UI: To prevent information overload, exercise details and videos are tucked into an interactive accordion.

Video Integration: Full support for embedding YouTube videos and Shorts.

Workout Builder: Real-time selection tool that allows users to add exercises to a "Current Session" list.

Admin Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities to manage the database directly through the app or terminal.
